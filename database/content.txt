<h1>Off the Rails, On the Airwaves</h1>
<p>
With the decline of the coal industry, 3 ex-miners trade in their picaxes for microphones
in this off the cuff radio show. Features include great ecclectic music, insightful talking segments,
and a surprising focus on bakery products. Our motto is, "Monetization at any cost!"
